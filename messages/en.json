      "title": "1964",
      "paragraph_one": "In September 1964, during the debate of Subcommittee III of the Special Committee on Decolonization, Ambassador José María Ruda delivered his famous argument stating that there was no population in the islands that was oppressed, subjugated, or subjected to colonialism, one of the reasons why that population is not entitled to the right to self-determination claimed by the British side.",

      "title": "1976",
      "paragraph_one": "In 1976, a situation of bilateral tension arose, fueled by various unilateral British actions in the dispute area. At the end of that year, the United Nations General Assembly, by a large majority and with the sole opposition of the United Kingdom, adopted Resolution 31/49, which once again recognized the continuous efforts of Argentina to facilitate the decolonization process and promote the well-being of the Islands' population, requested both governments to accelerate negotiations on the sovereignty dispute, as requested in Resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII), and urged both parties to refrain from adopting decisions that would entail the introduction of unilateral modifications in the situation while the Islands were going through the process recommended in the aforementioned resolutions."

Thus, in June each year, the C24 adopts by consensus a draft resolution reaffirming the validity of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, reiterating that the way to end the special and particular colonial situation regarding the question of the Malvinas Islands is through a peaceful and negotiated solution to the sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom, requesting both governments to resume sovereignty negotiations, and reiterating its support for the Secretary-General's good offices mission."
